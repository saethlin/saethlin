/u/Saefroch on Reddit, `@saethlin@hachyderm.io` on Mastodon, Saethlin everywhere else on the internet.

I do things like:
* Maintenance of [miri.saethlin.dev/ub](https://miri.saethlin.dev/ub) also known as [Crater At Home](https://github.com/saethlin/crater-at-home)
* Generally improving Miri, such as https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/109061. If you have trouble with Miri, let me know!
* Making the Rust compiler faster, sometimes unintentionally: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/115286
