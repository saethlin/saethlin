I'm currently working on...
* mmap/MMIO support in Miri: https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/2520
* Detecting alignment UB without Miri: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98112
* Maintenance of [miri.saethlin.dev/ub](https://miri.saethlin.dev/ub)
* Generally improving Miri, such as https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/109061. If you have trouble with Miri, let me know!
